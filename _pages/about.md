<h1>Whoami</h1>
<p>My real name is Furkan Deniz, I am 20 years old. I am currently an Economics student at Akdeniz University. At the same time, I am studying at Anadolu University, Department of Information Systems Management, as a second university.</p>
<p>I've been a computer user since I was 4-5 years old. Of course, from those times until now, I was just a gamer. This was how it progressed until 2018, but in 2018, my curiosity for learning permeated all over me. I had a curiosity about everything and a desire to learn not only about technology. Before that, I had an interest in everything, but I couldn't take action because of my age or because I didn't have a guide in this matter. It went on like this until I realized it myself and tried to quench the desire to learn. Being a self-learner is very valuable to me and makes me feel that there are no limits in front of me. And this feeling is amazing. I will continue to learn endlessly.</p>
