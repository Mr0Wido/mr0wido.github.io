<h1>Whoami</h1>
<p>My name is Furkan Deniz, and I am currently 20 years old. I am pursuing a degree in Economics at Akdeniz University. Additionally, I am studying Information Systems Management as a second university program at Anadolu University.</p>
<p>I have been using computers since I was around 4 or 5 years old. Initially, my interest in computers revolved around gaming. However, in 2018, my curiosity and desire to learn expanded beyond just gaming. I became eager to explore various subjects, not limited to technology alone. Previously, I had a general interest in many things, but due to various factors such as age or lack of guidance, I couldn't fully act upon those interests. However, I eventually realized my own potential and took it upon myself to quench my thirst for knowledge.</p>
<p>Being a self-learner holds immense value for me, as it gives me the freedom to explore without limits. This feeling is truly incredible, and it motivates me to continue learning endlessly. I am committed to pursuing knowledge and expanding my horizons without boundaries.</p>
