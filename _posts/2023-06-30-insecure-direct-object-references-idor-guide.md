### What is an IDOR? {#idor}
An `Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)` is a vulnerability that enables unauthorized access and the execution of actions on a targeted web application by an attacker.

Web applications often include `functions` that users can perform within their accounts, such as profile editing. However, to `prevent IDOR vulnerabilities`, proper `authorization checks` should be implemented for these functions. For instance, when a user with an `ID of 10` attempts to use the profile editing function, the web application should verify if this `action belongs to the user` with ID 10. `IF NOT`, the user may be able to `manipulate different IDs`, gaining unauthorized access to and editing profiles of other users. This is an example of an `IDOR`.

IDOR is a `dangerous and critical` vulnerability. Although a common vulnerability, it can be `much more complex and hard to detect`. The reason for this web applications get more complex as they grow. These complications lead to increased vulnerability. And because of these complications, it is difficult to detect the vulnerability.

Let's continue with an example from `Web Security Academy`.
