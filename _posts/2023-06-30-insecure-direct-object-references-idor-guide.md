### What is an IDOR? {#idor}

`IDOR` is a vulnerability that allows an attacker to get unauthorized access and perform actions on the target web application.

There are functions in a Web application that users can run from their accounts. For example, the profile editing function. 

Profile editing function is a simple function that each user can run from their account. An authorization check should be done in this function to avoid IDOR vulnerability. For example, when a user with `id=10` wants to use this function, the web application should check if this action belongs to the user with id=10. If not, the user can do this on different ids. This user can access and edit profiles of different ids without authorization. `This is IDOR`.


IDOR is a `dangerous and critical` vulnerability. Although a common vulnerability, it can be `much more complex and hard to detect`. The reason for this web applications get more complex as they grow. These complications lead to increased vulnerability. And because of these complications, it is difficult to detect the vulnerability.

Let's continue with an example from web security academy.
