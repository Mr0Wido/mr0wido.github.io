### 1.1 Uncover the flag!

Let's do a nmap scan.

```
$ nmap -sSV 10.10.39.168
```

![nmap](/assets/img/tryhackme/cyber-heroes/nmap.png)

Two ports are open. Theese are `22/tcp SSH and 80/tcp HTTP`. 

Let's visit the website running on `80/tcp` port. 

I found three pages on the website. These are `Home, About, and Login`.

Let's look at them all.

- _**`Home`**_ 

    ![home](/assets/img/tryhackme/cyber-heroes/home.png)

    I check the source page but I don't see anything significant.

- _**`About`**_ 

    I don't see anything significant on the page.

- _**`Login`**_ 

    ![login](/assets/img/tryhackme/cyber-heroes/login.png)

    I check the source page and I found this script.

    ![source](/assets/img/tryhackme/cyber-heroes/source.png)

    As I understand it `username: h3ck3rBoi` and `password: RevereString("54321@terceSrepuS")`.

    We need to write the password in reverse. So, `password: SuperSecret@12345`

Now that we've found the username and password, let's log in.

And the flag is here.
