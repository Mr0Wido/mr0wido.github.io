You talked a big game about being the most elite hacker in the solar system. Prove it and claim your right to the status of Elite Bounty Hacker!. 

Let's start.

<br>

## 1. Living up to the title. 

You were boasting on and on about your elite hacker skills in the bar and a few Bounty Hunters decided they'd take you up on claims! Prove your status is more than just a few glasses at the bar. I sense bell peppers & beef in your future! 

<br>

### 1.1 Deploy the machine. 

### 1.2 Find open ports on the machine

Let's do a nmap scan first.

```
$ nmap -sSCV 10.10.80.114
```

![nmap](/assets/img/tryhackme/bounty-hacker/nmap.png)

Three ports are open. These are **`21/tcp FTP, 22/tcp SSH, and 80/tcp HTTP`**. 


But first, let's check the website running on port 80. 
Here is a page like this.

![home](/assets/img/tryhackme/bounty-hacker/home.png)

I've been browsing this site  but haven't found anything remarkable. 

We don't have anything on website . Let's run a gobuster scan and see what we can find. 
I couldn't find anything.

### 1.3 Who wrote the task list? 

We see anonymous FTP login is allowed. So we login to the FTP server.

```
$ ftp anonymous@10.10.231.70
```

![ftp](/assets/img/tryhackme/bounty-hacker/ftp.png)

We see two files here. One of them is **`locks.txt`** and the other is **`task.txt`**. Let's get this file on our machine.

```
$ get locks.txt
$ get task.txt
```

Let's take a look at what is inside these files.

locks.txt : This file is a password list. 
  
  - ![locks](/assets/img/tryhackme/bounty-hacker/locks.png)

task.txt : This file is Lin's notes.

  - ![task](/assets/img/tryhackme/bounty-hacker/task.png)

Now, we have a username and list of passwords that we can use to ssh brute force.

**`Answer: lin`**

<br>

### 1.4 What service can you bruteforce with the text file found?

**`Answer: ssh`**

<br>

### 1.5 What is the users password?  

Let's do ssh brute force.

```
$ hydra -l lin -P locks.txt 10.10.231.70 -t 4 ssh
```

![hydra](/assets/img/tryhackme/bounty-hacker/hydra.png)

**`Answer: RedDr4gonSynd1cat3`**

<br>

### 1.6 user.txt

We found Lin's ssh password. Let's login to ssh.

```
$ ssh lin@10.10.231.70
```

![sshin](/assets/img/tryhackme/bounty-hacker/sshin.png)

Now we can reach the user flag. Let's get it.

![user-flag](/assets/img/tryhackme/bounty-hacker/user-flag.png)

<br>

### 1.6 root.txt 

Now, we need privilege escalation. So, I try the first **`sudo -l`** command. I entered the password and here it is.

![sudo](/assets/img/tryhackme/bounty-hacker/sudo.png)

As far as I can see, we can get root privileges using tar. I'm looking at [gtfobins](https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/tar/). and we found this.

![gtfobins](/assets/img/tryhackme/bounty-hacker/gtfobins.png)

```
$ sudo tar -cf /dev/null /dev/null --checkpoint=1 --checkpoint-action=exec=/bin/sh 
```

And we got root privilege. Now we can get to the root flag. Let's get it.
